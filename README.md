# Dependencies

Python: `stockfish`, `parse`, `chess`, `flask`, `twilio`, `psycopg` [binary]


# Immediate goals

Read FEN-format user move input

Get it running locally

`help` text gives possible user commands

Choose at start of game to be white or black

User commands:
 - `start`: begin a game. If a game is currently running, confirm whether to end current game
 - `forfeit`: user ends current game.

## Starting a game

 - Ask if user wants to be `white`, `black`, or `random`
 - Ask for difficulty. Either `easy`/`medium`/`hard`, or accept specific ELO

# Optional goals

More natural-ish language user commands

Prettier unicode/ascii boards
